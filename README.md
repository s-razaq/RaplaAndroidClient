Rapla Mobile Client for Android
===============================

Resource scheduling and event planing from your Android device

General Information
===================

[Rapla](https://code.google.com/p/rapla/) is a flexible multi-user resource and event planing system. It features multiple calendars views, conflict-management, fully configurable resource and event types and many import/export functions.

Unfortunately, you can only perform changes in the Rapla system from a computer with Internet access.

This mobile application for Android removes the obstacle and enables users to manage their event planing from smart phone.
