RaplaAndroidClient
==================

Resource scheduling and event planing from your Android device

General Information
===================

Rapla is a flexible multi-user resource and event planing system. It features multiple calendars views, conflict-management, fully configurable resource and event types and many import/export functions.

Unfortunately, you can only perform changes in the Rapla system from a computer with Internet access.

In the course of developments in the smart phone market, it would be desirable that Rapla  can be managed from a mobile device.

This mobile application for Android removes the obstacle and enables users to modify events from their smart phone.
